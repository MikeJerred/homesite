                                My role at Centuar was to write code for ASP.NET projects, fixing bugs and developing new features
                                on existing sites; as well as creating brand new sites, as part of a team of 6-7 developers.

                            <p>
                                I introduced angularjs to the team, and created the front-end architecture for a major new project.
                                This was a great success and the company is now using angular for current &amp; future projects.

                                - This site was built from scratch. It is a subscription service, where users are able to
                                search for information they require. At the start Iworked alone, designing the structure for the frontend
                                with a combination of angular, less and typescript. After this initial phase,

                                - This site had a major design overhaul and all the code was built as a new project, but using
                                the same data from the database. I started to build the site using ASP.NET vNext/Core, but decided
                                to revert to ASP.NET 4 fairly early on due to bugs in the software (at the time ASP.NET Core was in beta).
                                I used roughly the same architecture for the front-end as I used in the previous LMI project.

                                My role at Acturis was to maintain and add features to the company's product as part of an AGILE development team.
                                The product was mostly written in C#, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript with jQuery.
