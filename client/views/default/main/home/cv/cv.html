                                        My role at Centaur was to write code for various ASP.NET projects, fixing bugs and developing new features on existing sites; as well as creating brand new sites, as part of a team of 6-7 developers. The sites were built using C# for the back-end, with Microsoft SQL Server for the database engine and Apache Solr for creating indexes. A combination of AngularJs, Bootstrap, Typescript, LESS and Knockout were used for the front-end. Mercurial was used for version management.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of my main achievements was to introduce the AngularJs framework to the team, and use this to create the front-end architecture for two major new projects. These were a great success and the company is now using AngularJs as a standard for future projects.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                Example projects:
                                <ul class="projects">
                                    <li>
                                        <a href="http://thelawyermarketintelligence.com/" target="_blank">Lawyer Market Intelligence</a>
                                        - This site was built from the ground up, and including building a custom CMS. At the start I worked alone by designing the structure for the front-end with a combination of AngularJs, LESS and Typescript. After this initial phase the other developers joined in and we each worked on a separate module. Using this approach we were able to develop with a high degree of parallelization, and finished the project in a short space of time.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <a href="http://fashionmonitor.com/" target="_blank">Fashion Monitor</a>
                                        - This site had a major design overhaul and all the code was built from scratch, using a previously existing database. I used roughly the same architecture for the front-end as I used in the Lawyer Market Intelligence project, and we again developed it in a highly modular fashion with many developers working in parallel.
                                    </li>

                                        <a href="http://celebrityintelligence.com" target="_blank">Celebrity Intelligence</a>
                                        - My main involvement with this site was the creation of a search widget on the home page. It is able to filter by many different categories and display a count of the results very quickly, so to do this fast enough required using Apache Solr to create indexes from complex SQL queries.

                                        My role at Acturis was to maintain and add features to the company's product as part of an Agile development team. The product was mostly written in C#, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript with jQuery; there was also a lot of work with XML configuration files. The C# code was unit tested using Moq, and Subversion (SVN) was used for version management.
