                        My role at Centuar was to write code for ASP.NET projects, fixing bugs and developing new features
                        on existing sites; as well as creating brand new sites, as part of a team of 5-6 developers.

                        I introduced angularjs to the team, and created the front-end architecture for a major new project.
                        This was a great success and the company is now using angular for current &amp; future projects.
                        I built the initial application using Typescript, LESS and Angular. I used C# ASP.NET and SQL Server
                        for the backend - similar to the back-end of other projects in the company.

                        My role at Acturis was to maintain and add features to the company's product as part of an AGILE development team.
                        The product was mostly written in C#, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript with jQuery.

                        The role also involved a lot of work with XML configuration files, and supporting legacy browsers (IE6+).
