                My name is Mike, I'm originally from Manchester but have been living in London since 2012.
                I started learning to program from the age of 13, and used the internet teach myself.

                I have been working as a full-time web developer in a couple of different
                companies over the past {{aboutCtrl.getYearsSince(2012)}} years.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have experience working on existing monolithic codebases, as well as designing the code
                architecture and building sites from scratch. I usually use these technologies:
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS Pre-processor: LESS</li>
                    <li>Frontend MV* framework: AngularJS with Typescript</li>
                    <li>Package managers: npm, bower</li>
                    <li>Server: ASP.NET C# or Express with Node.js</li>
                    <li>Database: SQL Server or mongoDb</li>
                    <li>Package managers: npm and bower</li>
                    <li>Build tool: gulp</li>
                </ul>

        I first started programming when I was 13 years old. I begin by creating mods for video games, learning to
        write programs in a bespoke language used for missions in the GTA: III &amp; Vice City games. From there
        I started to learn C++ and asm x86 , as well as techniques for hacking games. I learnt how a buffer overflow
        could be exploited to allow code injection by modifying the game data files.

        <p>
            Later I started hacking the game Guild Wars, and further developed my reverse engineering and assembly skills.
            I also learnt some basics of DirectX and built a tool that drew a window in game and provided cheat functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2012 I started working as a full-time web developer, learning C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            In 2014 I left this company, and had a few months before starting a new job. During this time I learnt
            a lot about AngularJS, Typescript, and Node.js.
            Later in the year I started working again at a new company. During my time there I created the base
            for a new major project, and by using AngularJS and Typescript I introduced the technologies to the team.
            This was very successful
        </p>

        <p>
            I have developed an interest in functional programming, and have learnt some basics of Haskell. I intend to write
            a fun project with this language to aide my learning process.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am also very interested in the working of the human mind, and have begun learning about machine learning. I have found
            <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html" target="_blank">this</a> set of articles extremely helpful.

                    <p>
                        My role at Centuar was to write code for ASP.NET projects, fixing bugs and developing new features
                        on existing sites; as well as creating brand new sites, as part of a team of 5-6 developers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I introduced angularjs to the team, and created the front-end architecture for a major new project.
                        This was a great success and the company is now using angular for current &amp; future projects.
                        I built the initial application using Typescript, LESS and Angular. I used C# ASP.NET and SQL Server
                        for the backend - similar to the back-end of other projects in the company.
                    </p>

                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://thelawyermarketintelligence.com/">LMI</a> - We built this site from scratch. It is a single page app,
                            where users can login and edit content as well as view it.
                            I started by designing how the code will be structured - using a combination of angular, less and typescript for the front-end
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://fashionmonitor.com/">Fashion Monitor</a> - This site had a major design overhaul
                            and all the code was built as a new project, but using the same data from the database. I started to build the site
                            using ASP.NET vNext/Core, but decided to revert to ASP.NET 4 fairly early on due to bugs in the software (at the time ASP.NET Core was in beta).
                            I used roughly the same architecture for the front-end as I used in the previous LMI project.

                        My role at Acturis was to maintain and add features to the company's product as part of an AGILE development team.
                        The product was mostly written in C#, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript with jQuery.
